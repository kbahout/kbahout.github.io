        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Kay, I left Lebanon and moved to Canada three years ago. 
            My favourite season is summer so I really hate the canadian weather. I love cats and fashion, my favourite colors are purple and black. 
            I can fluently speak three languages, Arabic, french and English. I love listening to music especially Fairuz, Haifa Wehbe and Soolking songs.</p>
        <p>My hobbies are painting, reading and drawing henna designs. The books that I really enjoyed reading are the <em>Shatter Me</em> series by Tahere Mafi, <em>The Prophet</em> by Gibran Khalil Gibran and <em>The Metamorphosis</em> by <abbr title="Franz Kafka">F.K</abbr>. I'm also a Henna designer in my free time and love creating my own drawings.</p>
